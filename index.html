    <p>Dear Lawton Neighborhood Community,</p>

    <p>We are at immediate risk of losing <strong>5.3 acres of open green space</strong> behind Lawton Elementary School—stretching from Mershon Dr. up to the current school property line. This cherished area, used by children, families, and neighbors year-round, could soon be lost.</p>

    <p><strong>Please email City Council members Jen Eyer and Dharma Akmon, and key park district leaders to urge them to vote NO</strong> on the AAPS request to take over Lawton Park. The vote may happen as soon as <strong>Monday, April 14</strong>.</p>

    <h2>What’s Happening</h2>
    <p>AAPS originally proposed rebuilding Lawton on the existing site. Now, they plan to build a new school on the open green field behind the current building, replacing it with asphalt, parking, and storm ponds — and <strong>no playground</strong>.</p>

    <p>To fix this mistake, AAPS wants to take over <strong>5.3 more acres of public parkland</strong>, which would erase all the green space behind Lawton.</p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This is not what the community voted for in the 2019 bond.</li>
      <li>The plan shows poor planning that doesn’t prioritize student or community outdoor space.</li>
      <li>Green space is critical as Ann Arbor grows and densifies.</li>
      <li>AAPS already received <strong>$1 billion</strong> — they must work within their land!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
    <p>Please email the people below <strong>by Sunday</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>CityCouncil@a2gov.org</strong></li>
      <li><strong>JEyer@a2gov.org</strong></li>

Subject: Protect Lawton Park!

Dear City Council Members and Park District Leadership,

I am writing to urge you to vote NO on the proposal to allow Ann Arbor Public Schools to use or takeover city parkland as part of their shortsighted plan for the new Lawton Elementary School.

AAPS has their own property! Lawton has 7.7 acres with ample open green and playground space, however AAPS has managed to create a terrible plan for the new school that replaces greenspace with parking lots and asphalt and leaves no room for playgrounds or open play space. Now they are requesting to take an additional 5.3 acres of public parkland to make up for this poor planning! Our neighborhood values our green space and parks, and believe they are a critical part of the future of our community!

This is not what voters supported in the 2019 bond. Lawton students deserve open green space and playgrounds, and AAPS should revise its plan to use its existing land more responsibly—not take away shared community resources.

Please protect our Lawton City Park and vote no.

Sincerely,

Your name  
Address or ward # resident
