    <h2>What's Happening?</h2>

    <p>AAPS has determined that Lawton Elementary needs to be torn down and replaced. This process is to be supported using the 2019 Bond money.</p>

    <p>The conceptual site plan that AAPS has put forth for New Lawton places the new school on the playground and field behind the existing school, which then requires the use of the City's Lawton Park for the playground and recess areas.</p>

    <p>However, if this plan goes through, we will lose almost half of the open green space that is currently available on the combined AAPS-City properties. We will go from a combined 7.0 acres of open greenspace to 3.8 acres.</p>

    <h3>Weâ€™ve modeled the proposed site plan and calculated a number of other alarming changes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The playground area itself, even if City Council allows this plan, will be decreasing by 54%.</li>
      <li>The overall amount of outdoor area available to Lawton students is decreasing by 69%.</li>
      <li>The amount of paved areas is increasing by 160%.</li>
      <li>The amount of area that can be dark at night for wildlife and people is decreasing by 46%.</li>
    </ul>

      <p><strong><a href="takeaction.html">Write City Council</a> and tell them to vote NO on this proposal to use Lawton Park as a playground for Lawton Elementary School. AAPS can and must do better!</strong><br>
