Subject: Protect Lawton Park!

Dear City Council Members and Park District Leadership,

I am writing to urge you to vote NO on the proposal to allow Ann Arbor Public Schools to use or takeover city parkland as part of their shortsighted plan for the new Lawton Elementary School.

AAPS has their own property! Lawton has 7.7 acres with ample open green and playground space, however AAPS has managed to create a terrible plan for the new school that replaces greenspace with parking lots and asphalt and leaves no room for playgrounds or open play space. Now they are requesting to take an additional 5.3 acres of public parkland to make up for this poor planning! Our neighborhood values our green space and parks, and believe they are a critical part of the future of our community!

Please protect our Lawton City Park and vote no.

Sincerely,

Your name  
Address or ward # resident
