    <h2>By the Numbers</h2>

    <p>The general public and community haven’t gotten a lot of detail about the plan for a new Lawton Elementary. The best we have are pictures of the most recent site plan for New Lawton. We have some pictures that were shared with us by a community member, and there was a picture published by MLive in an article published on March 21, 2025 and written by Jackie Smith (Apple News link: https://apple.news/AE0P3AOTnT4uA2w-mB9Hc4A). The picture in the MLive article was used by permission, permission presumably granted by Quinn Evans Architects and consultant Beckett & Raeder, Inc. who created the conceptual plans for the site.</p>

    <p>We have taken these pictures and scaled their features using the GIS map (https://gisappsecure.ewashtenaw.org/Geocortex/WebViewer/?app=f0327644649f4fab96af11ca00b7e3b4&) of the AAPS Lawton property and the City of Ann Arbor Lawton Park property. Scaling was done using the length of the back property line of a bordering neighbor property.</p>

    <p>We created 3D models of both the existing Lawton site and the proposed New Lawton site in order to correctly compare the two site plans. Our analysis of the various areas shows that AAPS and their contractors have proposed a site plan for New Lawton that severely reduces outdoor space for both students and the general community.</p>

    <h3>The major categories of surface area in the site plans are:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Paved areas – parking lots, drop-off lanes, etc.</li>
      <li>Transition areas – front of the school circulation area for arriving and departing; combination of sidewalks, paved areas, flower beds, shrubberies, etc.</li>
      <li>Outdoor playground areas – play structures, swing sets, outdoor learning, hard surfaces for games, etc.</li>
      <li>Grassy areas for recess – open area for general running around, kicking a soccer ball, etc.</li>
      <li>Storm water retention areas – necessary as we all know the fields get soggy when it rains!</li>
      <li>City park areas – area of the city’s Lawton Park that is open to the general public even during school hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Below is a series of comparisons between the existing amount of each category and the amount of each category in the proposed design by AAPS. Click the slides to advance through the slide show.</p>

    <p>We are confident that our 3D modeling is sufficiently accurate for this reporting. You can see above that each category is proposed to have a major negative shift for Lawton students and the surrounding community. We are losing so much that cannot be replaced until the next time Lawton is rebuilt… which should be well after all of us are gone from this world. We need a totally new plan that responsibly uses the 7.7 acres of land that AAPS already owns and manages for Lawton Elementary.</p>
